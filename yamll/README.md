# Machine Learning Algorithms
Some machine learning algorithms implementation in Python and Numpy

## Modules

### Linear methods (module `linear`)

#### Linear regression

*linear_regression.py* contains `LinearRegression` class - an implementation of linear regression model with L1 and L2 regulatization

### Features space (module `features`)

#### Polynomial features
*polynomial_features.py* contains `PolynomialFeatures` static class which allows to expand basis to polynomial features for use in linear models
